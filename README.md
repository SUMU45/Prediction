# Prediction
It is a project that can predict how many students could admit in the upcoming semester.
As I'm a student from North East University Bangladesh so for doing this project my teacher told me to collect real datasets from our admission office. So I collected data from the office and put it on an excel sheet whose name is dataset2.csv 
After sorting the data I use linear regression algorithm and build a model of it.
With this model, I train the dataset and calculate the coefficient of the dataset. 
After doing all this, now if we write the department, semester and year, then we can easily know how many students will be admitted in which department.
